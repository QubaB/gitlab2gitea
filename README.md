# gitlab2gitea
Import issues, comments and their atachements from Gitlab to Gitea

Code is very dirty as I put it together with assistance of chatGPT

In case of need look at API documentation, for example:
- https://docs.gitea.com/api/1.20/#tag/issue/operation/issueListIssueAttachments
- https://docs.gitea.com/api/1.20/#tag/issue/operation/issueListIssueCommentAttachments
- https://docs.gitlab.com/api/projects/
